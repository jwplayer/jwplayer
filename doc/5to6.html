<h1>Migrating from JW5 to JW6</h1>

<p>This guide enumerates all differences in functionality for JW Player 6 (JW6) compared to JW Player 5 (JW5). It is written for existing JW Player users, to assist them in upgrading from JW5 to JW6. The differences are grouped by topic.</p>

<p>For each topic, both added and removed features are listed. In the latter case, suggestions for alternative setups are provided.</p>



<h2>Media Support</h2>

<p>Due to its revamped media selection engine, JW6 supports multiple content types in multiple qualities, using an inline setup or RSS feed. The <strong>Premium</strong> and <strong>Ads</strong> editions include support for Apple HLS in Flash.</p>

<h3>Added</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Defined list of formats</dt>
<dd>The docs for JW6 clearly define all <a href="media.html">supported media formats</a>, including their expected extensions and mimetypes. JW6 supports MP4/FLV/WebM video, AAC/MP3/Vorbis audio, YouTube and HLS/RTMP streams.</dd>
<dt>Setting multiple formats</dt>
<dd>Setting multiple formats for one clip (RTMP+MP4, MP4+WebM, etc) has become more flexible and easier in JW6. Simply provide a list of sources using <a href="playlists.html">inline playlists</a> or <a href="feeds.html">mRSS feeds</a>. JW Player automatically detects and filters which formats can be played on each device.</dd>
<dt>Apple HLS in Flash</dt>
<dd>In the <strong>Premium</strong> and <strong>Ads</strong> editions, JW6 supports HTTP adaptive streaming through the <a href="hls.html">Apple HLS protocol</a>. In addition to iOS, HLS streams can also be played on the desktop (in Flash mode). Both live and on-demand are supported.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Removed</h3>

<dl>
<dt>JPG/PNG/GIF images</dt>
<dd>JW6 does not support playback of JPG/PNG/GIF images in Flash mode anymore. We suggest using one of the many free (and much better suited) JavaScript image galleries for playing images.</dd>
<dt>Ogg videos</dt>
<dd>JW6 does not officially support the Ogg video format anymore. <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/blog/24509/encoding-webm-videos">WebM</a> is more modern, more widely used, and now supported by the same percentage of the browser market.</dd>
</dl>



<h2>Device Support</h2>

<p>One of the major internal changes in JW6 is a full refactor of its HTML5 playback. The HTML5 rendering mode is now leaner, more stable and in support of recent browser features.</p>

<h3>Added</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Defined list of devices</dt>
<dd>The docs for JW6 clearly define all <a href="browsers.html">supported browsers &amp; devices</a>, including their supported rendering modes. JW6 officially supports the Chrome/Firefox/Internet Explorer/Opera/Safari browsers and iOS/Android devices.</dd>
<dt>Defaulting to HTML5</dt>
<dd>JW6 automatically detects if a device supports Flash and HTML5. It also detects if the embedded media format can be played back in Flash or HTML5. If both are possible, JW6 defaults to HTML5. Override this by using the <strong>primary</strong> configuration option.</dd>
<dt>Download fallback</dt>
<dd>If a device supports neither Flash nor HTML5, JW6 renders a so-called <a href="browsers.html">download fallback</a>: a nicely formatted download link to the media that is picked up by a built-in media player. This works great on e.g. Blackberry phones. The fallback includes support for YouTube on Android/iOS.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Removed</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Flash mode on Android</dt>
<dd>Flash support and availability on Android is lackluster. JW6 therefore does not support Flash on Android. Please make your media compatible with HTML5 when targeting Android devices.</dd>
</dl>



<h2>Embedding</h2>

<p>For JW6, we rationalized the various methods used to embed JW Player. The <a href="embedding.html">jwplayer().setup()</a> call is now the only valid method to embed media.</p>

<h3>Added</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Separate embedder</dt>
<dd>In JW6, the library that manages the player embed (<strong>jwplayer.js</strong>) is separated from the actual HTML5 player (<strong>jwplayer.html5.js</strong>). This means the full HTML5 player is not loaded if the Flash player (<strong>jwplayer.flash.swf</strong>) is selected, saving ~100kb of data transfer.</dd>
<dt>Setup and media errors</dt>
<dd>JW6 features a documented list of player setup and media playback errors. All errors are descriptive (no more "Error #2032") and clearly printed in the player space. See <a href="troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting Your Setup</a> to identify and resolve an error.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Removed</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Embedding with <em>&lt;embed&gt;</em> or <em>SWFObject</em></dt>
<dd>JW6 focuses on HTML5/mobile and on robust player-page interaction using the <a href="javascripting.html">JavaScript API</a>. Embedding only the SWF player is not supported anymore. If you rely heavily on SWF-only embedding, we suggest you continue using JW5 (which we support until JW7 launches).</dd>
<dt>Embedding over a <em>&lt;video&gt;</em> tag</dt>
<dd>JW6 supports many functionalities not supported by a &lt;video&gt; tag (e.g. Flash, RSS, YouTube, RTMP, VAST). Additionally, longer term promises of an inline &lt;video&gt; element (progressive enhancement, video SEO, accessibility) are not there yet. Therefore, JW6 does not support the enhancing of a video element yet.</dd>
</dl>



<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>Compared to JW5, JW6 contains a much shorter list of configuration options, while maintaining its flexibility. Many legacy options, or options that do not work cross-platform, are removed.</p>


<h3>Added</h3>

<dl>
<dt>New <em>primary</em> toggle</dt>
<dd>The <a href="browsers.html">Flash/HTML5 mode selection</a> in JW6 is greatly enhanced compared to JW5. Therefore, the <strong>modes</strong> configuration block (and all the confusion it created) is removed. Instead, set your preferred rendering mode with a simple <a href="embedding.html">primary toggle</a>.</dd>
<dt>New <em>fallback</em> toggle</dt>
<dd>The <a href="browsers.html">download fallback</a> introduced in JW5 can now be disabled with a single <a href="embedding.html">fallback toggle</a>. The fallback won't attempt RTMP/HLS downloads and has a special case for Youtube. When disabled, the original HTML of the container &lt;div&gt; is not touched by JW Player.</dd>
<dt>New <em>listbar</em> replaces <em>playlist.position</em></dt>
<dd>In order to differentiate the visual playlist options from the inline playlist block, JW6 groups all settings related to the visual playlist under a <a href="playlists.html">new block called listbar</a>.</dd>
<dl>

<h3>Removed</h3>

<dl>
<dt>The <em>modes</em> block and <em>flashplayer</em> option</dt>
<dd>In JW6, the flash, html5 and download modes are set with two basic toggles (<strong>primary</strong> and <strong>fallback</strong>) instead of a <strong>modes</strong> block. It is also not needed anymore to specifically point to the location of <strong>jwplayer.flash.swf</strong>. Instead, JW6 presumes the file (and <strong>jwplayer.html5.js</strong>) is in the same location as the main <strong>jwplayer.js</strong> library.</dd>
<dt>The <em>controlbar</em>, <em>dock</em> and <em>icons</em> options</dt>
<dd>In the revamped JW6 interface, all video controls show/hide in unison. Their placement and appearance are optimized for every player state. As a consequence, it is not possible anymore to show or hide individual parts of the controls. Instead, a single <a href="embedding.html">controls option</a> is available to enable or disable all controls together.</dd>
<dt>The <em>link</em> and <em>displayclick</em> options</dt>
<dd>These options are removed to tighten up display UX and avoid XSS security issues. Publishers can still implement Call-To-Action features in JW6 using <a href="logo.html">the logo block</a>, or respond to display clicks using the <a href="script-reference.html">onDisplayClick</a> API call.</dd>
<dt>The <em>repeat</em> and <em>shuffle</em> options</dt>
<dd>Repeat is simplified to a basic <strong>true/false</strong> toggle, which plays the playlist either once or continuos. This ensures subsequent items in playlists play on mobile. The ability to shuffle playlist items is removed, but trivial to build with a <a href="scripting.html">few lines of JavaScript</a></dd>
<dt>The <em>front/back/light/screencolor</em> options</dt>
<dd>Due to technical limitations, these options only worked in Flash. The new <a href="skins.html">PNG Skinning Model</a> has many more features beyond setting the colors of controls.</dd>
<dt>The <em>bufferlength</em> and <em>smoothing</em> options</dt>
<dd>These options catered only to the Flash mode. Video is now always smoothed through StageVideo. The <a href="rtmp.html">bufferlength for RTMP</a> can still be set, e.g. to enable low-latency live streaming.</dd>
<dt>The <em>config</em> option</dt>
<dd>The removal of &lt;embed&gt; support also removed the need for external XML configurations. They can now be loaded as part of the player itself, e.g. using JSONp callbacks or an <strong>&lt;iframe&gt;</strong> tag.</dd>
<dt>The logo <em>over</em>, <em>out</em>, <em>linktarget</em> and <em>timeout</em> options</dt>
<dd>Instead of <strong>logo.over</strong> and <strong>logo.out</strong>, use a PNG with alpha channel to set transparency. When setting the logo <strong>hide</strong> option, the timeout logo fades is now synchronized with the other controls.</dd>
</dl>



<h2>Playlists</h2>

<p>JW6 rationalizes playlist support around inline JSON and RSS feeds. With both mechanisms, multiple media sources can now be set per item, for optimal cross-platform support.</p>

<h3>Added</h3>

<dl>
<dt>One <em>playlist</em> block for all setups</dt>
<dd>JW6 greatly simplifies the options for loading media. For basic configurations, the <a href="embedding.html">file, image and title options</a> can be set. For more advanced setups, the <strong>playlist</strong> option is required. It  can be an <a href="playlists.html">inline configuration block</a> or the <a href="feeds.html">link to an RSS feed</a>. Loading feeds through <strong>file</strong> or <strong>playlistfile</strong> does no longer work.</dd>
<dt>New <em>sources</em> block instead of <em>levels</em> block</dt>
<dd>JW6 replaces the <strong>levels</strong> configuration block with a more flexible <strong>sources</strong> block. It is <a href="playlists.html">part of every playlist item</a>. Use <strong>sources</strong> to provide multiple media formats, multiple quality levels or multiple formats with multiple qualities.</dd>
<dt>New <em>type</em> option instead of <em>provider</em> option</dt>
<dd>JW6 automatically <a href="media.html">recognizes media formats</a> by their file extension or URL syntax (rtmp, youtube). If a file cannot be detected, set the <strong>type</strong> option to <a href="media.html">force a media type</a>. This replaces the <strong>provider</strong> option, which was tied to Flash-specific APIs.</dd>
<dt>Multiple formats in RSS feeds</dt>
<dd>The migration from levels to sources provides the ability to <a href="feeds.html">set multiple media sources</a> for each item in an RSS feeds. For example, an MP4 video plus HLS manifest can now be loaded with one feed.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Removed</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Feeds in XSPF/ASX/ATOM format</dt>
<dd>In order to improve clarity and reduce the filesizes, JW6 only supports mRSS feeds. mRSS supports all features offered by other formats, so <a href="feeds.html">migrating to mRSS</a> is not a technical problem.</dd>
<dt>The <em>start</em> and <em>duration</em> options</dt>
<dd>JW6 drops support for trimming videos with these options. It worked inconsistently on desktop browsers and not at all on mobile devices. Instead, trim your videos serverside, using a tool like <a href="http://www.wowza.com/forums/content.php?326">Wowza Media Server</a> or <a href="http://h264.code-shop.com/trac/wiki/Mod-H264-Streaming">Mod H264 Streaming</a>. Note that dedicated <a href="http://www.wowza.com/forums/content.php?326">chaptering support</a> is coming, which reduces the need for this functionality.</dd>
</dl>



<h2>Captions</h2>

<p>JW6 has built-in support for closed captions and subtitles. This replaces the external Captions plugin. A CC button on the controlbar will automatically appear when captions are available.</p>

<h3>Added</h3>

<dl>
<dt>WebVTT captions</dt>
<dd>JW6 brings basic support for <a href="captions.html">WebVTT captions</a>, a new format standardized in HTML5.</dd>
<dt>DFXP in HTML5</dt>
<dd>JW6 brings support for <a href="captions.html">DFXP captions</a> to HTML5 mode, whereas the former JW5 plugin only supported DFXP in Flash.</dd>
<dt>Captions in playlists or feeds</dt>
<dd>JW6 supports setting multiple captions as file/label combinations in inline playlists. Additionally, JW6 supports <strong>media:subtitle</strong> in RSS feeds to load multiple captions per playlist item.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Removed</h3>

<dl>
<dt>The <em>captions.file(s)</em> properties</dt>
<dd>Captions now have to get loaded as part of a playlist. This is done through either a playlist captions sub-block or <strong>media:subtitle</strong> in RSS.</dd>
<dt>Styling in DFXP files</dt>
<dd>JW6 drops support for styling in DFXP captions, aligning its supported feature set with WebVTT and SRT. Styling <a href="captions.html">through configuration options</a> is still supported.</dd>
</dl>



<h2>Skinning</h2>

<p>JW6 contains a much slicker default skin, as well as many UX enhancements (like the use of subtle animations).</p>

<h3>Added</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Tooltip component</dt>
<dd>A new <a href="skinning.html">tooltip component</a> is available to skin HD and CC selection menus, timeslider tooltip, vertical volume bar and dock button texts.</dd>
<dt>Video title and error message</dt>
<dd>JW6 allows for displaying the title of a video or the message of a media error in the middle of the display. Both their <a href="skin-reference.html">text style and canvas</a> can be fully skinned. There's also a new <strong>replay</strong> icon, shown instead of the <strong>play</strong> icon after a video completed.</dd>
<dt>HD/CC buttons and slider caps</dt>
<dd>The buttons for calling HD (quality) and CC (captions) menus are now built into the <a href="skin-reference.html">controlbar skinning model</a>. Additionally, end caps are supported for every layer in the controlbar timeslider.</dd>
<dt>Dock caps and dividers</dt>
<dd>The dock, which groups all non-playback functionalities, is made smaller and placed in the top-left of the player. It is not possible to add <a href="skin-reference.html">end caps and dividers</a> to the dock, as well as setting icon rollovers using alpha values.</dd>
<dt>Playlist titles and dividers</dt>
<dd>The titles of items in the <a href="skin-reference.html">playlist component</a> can now be independently styled from the descriptions. Additionally a divider element can be placed in between playlist items.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Removed</h3>

<dl>
<dt>ZIP packaging</dt>
<dd>JW6 does not support packaging skins in a ZIP file anymore (b/c this does not work in HTML5). Instead, skins can be packed by <a href="skinning.html">inlining images</a> as base64 encoded strings. This has the same delivery improvements as ZIP files (faster, single file) and works in both Flash and HTML5.</dd>
<dt>The <em>layout</em> block</dt>
<dd>The controlbar <strong>layout</strong> allowed for non-default button arrangements or multiple dividers. JW6 does not support this anymore, but hiding buttons is still possible by omitting the button elements.</dd>
<dt>The horizontal volume slider</dt>
<dd>The horizontal volume slider of JW5 is replaced with a vertical one (in the tooltip) for JW6. This leaves more space for the timeslider, for increased seeking accuracy.</dd>
<dt>SWF skinning</dt>
<dd>JW6 does not support SWF skins anymore. The newer <a href="skinning.html">PNG skinning model</a> is more flexible, less error-prone and more compatible than the SWF model.</dd>
</dl>



<h2>JavaScript API</h2>

<p>On the JavaScript side, JW6 builds upon the API established in JW5 with some clarifications and new API classes.</p>

<h3>Added</h3>

<dl>
<dt>The <em>Quality</em> API</dt>
<dd>This new set of API calls allows scripts to listen to or modify which quality level is currently playing in a player. See the <a href="script-reference.html">Javascript API Reference</a> for details.</dd>
<dt>The <em>Button</em> API</dt>
<dd>This new set of API calls allows scripts to add and remove custom buttons to/from the player interface. Use this API to easily extend the player functionality or have player and webpage interact with each other. See the <a href="script-reference.html">Javascript API Reference</a> for details.</dd>
<dt>The <em>Controls</em> API</dt>
<dd>This new API can be used to enable/disable the built-in controls, to get the display regions they overlay, and to listen to clicks on the display. See the <a href="script-reference.html">Javascript API Reference</a> for details.</dd>
<dt>The <em>getRenderingMode</em> variable</dt>
<dd>This new getter returns whether JW Player is rendered in <strong>html5</strong> or <strong>flash</strong> on the current device.</dd>
<dt>The <em>onPlaylistComplete</em> event</dt>
<dd>This new event fires when JW6 has completed playing all items in a playlist. If a player is set to <strong>repeat</strong>, the event is never fired. The event is better suited than the existing <strong>onComplete</strong> event for determining when a player is done playing everything.</dd>
</dl>


<h3>Removed</h3>

<dl>
<dt>The <em>events</em> configuration block</dt>
<dd>This way of adding event listeners is fully redundant with <a href="scripting.html">adding listeners outside the setup</a>, both in terms of features and amount of code required.</dd>
<dt>The JW4 <em>playerReady</em> API</dt>
<dd>JW6 dropped support for the <strong>playerReady</strong> API, in favor of the much more extensive <a href="scripting.html">JavaScript API</a>.</dd>
</dl>



<h2>Analytics</h2>

<p>JW6 introduces the free JW Player Analytics service, available to all JW Player users. The <strong>Premium</strong> and <strong>Ads</strong> editions also support Google Analytics.</p>

<h3>Added</h3>

<dl>
<dt>JW Player Analytics</dt>
<dd>A <a href="analytics.html">free analytics service</a> that enables all JW Player users to see how their video streams are performing.</dd>
<dt>Google Analytics</dt>
<dd>This former plugin <a href="gapro.html">is now built-in</a> for the <strong>Premium</strong> and <strong>Ads</strong> editions, making it straightforward to setup.</dd>
</dl>



<h2>Streaming</h2>

<p>A new Quality API allows for manual quality selection across streaming technologies. HLS support across Flash and HTML5 (in the <strong>Premium</strong> and <strong>Ads</strong> editions) allows publishers to leverage HTTP adaptive streaming.</p>

<h3>Added</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Manual quality switching</dt>
<dd>For every media format, there's now the ability to set multiple quality levels. Viewers can select their preferred quality through a controlbar tooltip menu. For RTMP and YouTube, JW6 includes an <strong>auto</strong> quality level. When enabled, the optimal quality is automatically selected based upon bandwidth and screen size.</dd>
<dt>Apple HLS in Flash</dt>
<dd>The <strong>Premium</strong> and <strong>Ads</strong> editions of JW6 support HTTP adaptive streaming through the <a href="hls.html">Apple HLS protocol</a>. In addition to iOS, HLS streams can be played on the desktop (in Flash mode). Both on-demand and live are supported.</dd>
<dt>Loading single RTMP URLs</dt>
<dd>JW6 support loading of a <a href="rtmp.html">single RTMP URL</a>, instead of a separate file/streamer setup. This eases RTMP setups and makes RTMP compatible with multi-format loading using both <a href="playlists.html">inline playlists</a> and <a href="feeds.html">RSS feeds</a> (e.g. RTMP+MP4). For dynamic streams, <a href="rtmp.html">SMIL manifests</a> are required.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Removed</h3>

<dl>
<dt>HTTP bitrate switching</dt>
<dd>In JW6, <a href="pseudo.html">HTTP pseudo-streaming for Flash</a> is set with a single, global <strong>startparam</strong> option. In HTML5, pseudo-streaming works by default. Both modes support the new manual quality switching options, but will not automatically switch bitrates anymore.</dd>
<dt>RTMP dynamic streaming using levels</dt>
<dd>JW6 does not anymore support loading of RTMP dynamic streams by setting quality levels, either with an inline playlist or an RSS feed. Instead, <a href="rtmp.html">SMIL manifests</a> must be used for dynamic streaming at all times. This ensures multiple media formats can be loaded using a single playlist or feed (e.g. RTMP+MP4).</dd>
<dt>RTMP tunneling fallback</dt>
<dd>Due to the diversity of RTMP setups (ports, firewalls, protocols), the automated RTMP tunneling feature in JW5 tended to create as many issues as it solved. Therefore, this is removed from JW6. Instead, we ensure <a href="script-reference.html"> the onError() event</a> is called when an RTMP server cannot be reached. Publishers can then fallback from RTMP in any way they wish using a few lines of JavaScript code.</dd>
<dt>RTMP DVRCast</dt>
<dd>RTMP DVRCast is removed from JW6 due to its sparse use and unstable streaming. Instead, both the CDNs that supported DVRCast and JW Player will focus on <a href="http://developer.longtailvideo.com/trac/ticket/1644">DVR using HTTP adaptive streaming</a>. Using <a href="rtmp.html">FC Subscribe</a> for RTMP live streaming continues to work.</dd>
</dl>



<h2>Discovery</h2>

<p>The <strong>Premium</strong> and <strong>Ads</strong> editions of JW6 include <em>video sharing</em> and <em>related videos</em> features.</p>

<h3>Added</h3>

<dl>
<dt>The <em>sharing</em> and <em>related</em> blocks.</dt>
<dd>The <strong>Premium</strong> and <strong>Ads</strong> editions of JW6 can set a <a href="sharing.html">social sharing</a> and <a href="related.html">related videos</a> overlay with built-in configuration blocks.</dd>
</dl>



<h2>Advertising</h2>

<p>JW6 integrates all its advertising support into the <strong>Ads</strong> edition. This makes setup the advertising client and schedule both easier and faster. <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/contact-us/">Please contact us</a> if you are running ads in JW5 and want info on migrating to JW6.</p>


<!--
<h2>Plugins</h2>

<p>JW6 de-emphasizes its plugin model in favor of more built-in features (hd, captions, tooltips), the <strong>Premium</strong> edition (gapro, sharing, related), the <strong>Ads</strong> edition (ova, googima, adtonomy) and a more extensive <a href="scripting.html">JavaScript API</a>. However, JW6 continues to support building and loading plugins to add 3rd party functionality.</p>

<h3>Added</h3>

<dl>
<dt>The <em>quality</em>, <em>button</em> and <em>controls</em> APIs.</dt>
<dd>JW6 contains new API classes for changing video quality, setting dock buttons and enabling/disabling controls.  See the <a href="script-reference.html">Javascript API Reference</a> for details.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Removed</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Centralized plugin hosting</dt>
<dd>JW6 cannot load plugins from a central CDN repository anymore. Instead, plugins always have to get loaded <a href="plugins.html">from a certain URL</a>.</dd>
<dt>Deep access to components/plugins</dt>
<dd>In JW6, plugins cannot access player components or other plugins anymore. Only the general JavaScript API is available to interact with JW Player. This means that e.g. showing and hiding the controlbar must be done with the <a href="script-reference.html#controls">Controls API</a> and adding of dock buttons must be done with the <a href="script-reference.html#button">Button API</a>.</dd>
<dt>Custom controlbar buttons</dt>
<dd>In JW6, plugins can only add buttons to the dock, using the <a href="script-reference.html#button">Button API</a>. The controlbar cannot be modified anymore. This restriction is added to provide end users with a clearer UX and to have JW Player behave the same across desktop browsers and devices (where built-in controls are used).</dd>
<dt>Skinning API for Flash plugins</dt>
<dd>In JW5, Flash plugins could implement this API to allow publishers to skin their assets with the <a href="skinning.html">XML/PNG skinning model</a>. Since the only plugins that used this model (captions, sharing, hd) are now part of JW6, the API is removed.</dd>
</dl>
