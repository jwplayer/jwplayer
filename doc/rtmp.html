<h1>Using RTMP Streaming</h1>

<p>This guide provides an overview on RTMP streaming with JW Player 6.  It is available in all JW6 editions, including <strong>Free</strong>.</p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>RTMP (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Messaging_Protocol">Real Time Messaging Protocol</a>) is a system for delivering on-demand and live media to Adobe Flash applications (like JW Player). RTMP supports video in MP4 and FLV and audio in AAC and MP3. RTMP offers several advantages over regular HTTP video downloads:</p>

<ul>
<li>RTMP can do <strong>live</strong> streaming, so people can watch your video while it is being recorded.</li>
<li>RTMP can do <strong>dynamic</strong> streaming, where the video quality automatically adjusts to changes in bandwidth.</li>
<li>Players can swiftly <strong>seek</strong> to later parts in a video, which is great for files > 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Players maintains a tiny <strong>buffer</strong>, instead of downloading a video during playback, saving bandwidth.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>

<p>However, do note that RTMP has its disadvantages too. The most important ones are:</p>

<ul>
<li>RTMP uses different protocols and ports than HTTP, which makes it vulnerable to getting blocked by (corporate) firewalls. This issue can be prevented by streaming in RTMPT (tunneling over HTTP), which comes at a server performance cost.</li>
<li>RTMP data is streamed to the player, which means the bandwidth of the connection must be larger than the data-rate of the video. If the connection drops for a couple of seconds, the stream will stutter. This issue can largely be prevented by using <strong>dynamic</strong> streams that include a low-quality file.</li>
</ul>

<p>The biggest drawback is that RTMP only works in Flash and not in HTML5. New HTTP streaming protocols, like Apple's HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), have wider device support (e.g. iOS) and will likely replace RTMP over the coming years. JW Player <a href="hls.html">supports Apple HLS</a> in both Flash and HTML5 mode.</p>



<h2>Server Support</h2>

<p>In order to use RTMP, your host or CDN needs to have a dedicated RTMP server installed. There are two major offerings, both supported by JW Player:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.wowza.com/">Wowza Media Server</a> is today's most widely used solution. It includes support for almost any streaming protocol, including RTMP. Wowza 3 introduced dedicated support for JW6 SMIL manifests  (see below)</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-media-server-family.html">Adobe Media Server</a> is another great option. Since Flash is developed by Adobe, new RTMP functionalities find their way in FMS first.</li>
</ul>

<h3>CDNs</h3>

<p>The following CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) support RTMP and are tested to work great with JW Player. They all support <strong>dynamic</strong> streaming and, with the exception of CloudFront, <strong>live</strong> streaming too:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.akamai.com/">Akamai</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cdnetworks.com/">CDNetworks</a></li>
<li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">CloudFront</a> (Amazon Web Services)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.edgecast.com/">Edgecast</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.limelight.com/">Limelight</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Live Streaming</h3>

<p>A key feature of RTMP is the ability to do live streaming, e.g. of presentations, concerts or sports events. Next to JW Player and an RTMP server, one then also needs a small tool to ingest the live video into the server. There's a bunch of such tools available. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-media-encoder.html">Flash Live Media Encoder</a> is free and available for Windows and Mac.</p>

<p>With both FMS and Wowza, a live stream is embedded in exactly the same way as an on-demand stream. However, the Akamai, Edgecast and Limelight CDNs require a player to <em>subscribe</em> to a live stream. JW Player <a href="#fcsubscribe">supports this mechanism</a>.</p>

<p>JW Player will embed and play a live stream like an on-demand file, with one exception: instead of displaying a slider to scrub through the timeline, the player will display the <em>title</em> of the event in the controlbar.</p>



<h2>Embedding a Stream</h2>

<p>Embedding an RTMP stream into JW Player is simply a matter of providing the full stream URL. Here is a very basic example, playing a single MP4 video:</p>

<pre>
jwplayer("myElement").setup({
    file: "rtmp://example.com/application/mp4:myVideo.mp4",
    image: "/assets/myVideo.jpg",
    height: 360,
    width: 640
});
</pre>

<p>Above example only works on desktops, since Flash is not available on mobile. Below is another example, using an MP4 loaded over both RTMP and HTTP. The RTMP stream will be played on desktops, the HTTP download will be played on devices:</p>

<pre>
jwplayer("myElement").setup({
    playlist: [{
        image: "/assets/myVideo.jpg",
        sources: [{ 
            file: "rtmp://example.com/application/mp4:myVideo.mp4"
        },{
            file: "/assets/myVideo.mp4"
        }]
    }],
    height: 360,
    primary: "flash",
    width: 640
});
</pre>

<p>Since the <strong>primary</strong> rendering mode is set to <em>Flash</em>, the RTMP stream is picked over the MP4. If this option were not set, JW Player would play the HTTP download, since many browsers (e.g. Chrome, Internet Explorer) support that in HTML5 (the default mode in JW6).</p>

<p>See <a href="playlists.html">Working with Playlists</a> for more info on loading multiple sources.</p>

<h3>Application and Stream</h3>

<p>Technically, an RTMP stream consists of two pieces:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>application</strong> path (e.g. <em>rtmp://example.com/vod/</em>).</li>
<li>The <strong>stream</strong> identifier (e.g. <em>mp4:video.mp4</em>).</li>
</ul>

<p>In JW Player, these two pieces are rolled up into a single URL. JW Player determines the split between application and stream based upon the following rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>If a <em>_definst_</em> is found, the player splits immediately after that. Example: <pre>rtmp://example.com/vod/_definst_/myFolder/myVideo.mp4</pre>.</li>
<li>If a <em>prefix</em> (e.g. <em>mp4:</em>) is found, the player splits immediately before that. Example: <pre>rtmp://example.com/vod/mp4:myFolder/myVideo.mp4</pre></li>
<li>If neither a _definst_ nor a prefix are found, the player splits after the last <em>/</em> in the filename. Example: <pre>rtmp://example.com/vod/myVideo.mp4</pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that a <em>_definst_</em> delimiter can always be inserted without resulting into problems for video streaming. Also note that prefixes and file extensions are automatically set correctly by JW Player before the RTMP stream is loaded. See the documentation of your RTMP server for more information on these subjects.</p>



<h2>Dynamic streaming</h2>

<p>In addition to loading a single RTMP stream, JW Player supports loading <strong>dynamic</strong> streams. A dynamic stream consists of multiple single streams of the same content, all in a different quality. JW Player allows automated or manual switching between the different qualities in such a stream.</p>

<p>Dynamic streams have to be set up using so-called SMIL manifests. These are simple XML files that contain the location of the RTMP application, plus the path to (one or more) streams stored on the RTMP server. The player always presume a file with the extension <em>.smil</em> is an RTMP SMIL manifest:</p>

<pre>
jwplayer("myElement").setup({
    file: "/assets/myVideo.smil",
    image: "/assets/myVideo.jpg",
    height: 360,
    width: 640
});
</pre>

<p>Here is another example, using both an RTMP dynamic stream (for desktops) and a progressive MP4 download (for mobile):</p>

<pre>
jwplayer("myElement").setup({
    playlist: [{
        image: "/assets/myVideo.jpg",
        sources: [{ 
            file: "/assets/myVideo.smil" 
        },{
            file: "/assets/myVideo.mp4" 
        }]
    }],
    height: 360,
    primary: "flash",
    width: 640
});
</pre>

<p>Note that SMIL manifests are subject to <a href="crossdomain.html">Cross-domain Security Restrictions</a>. If your SMIL files are located on a different server than your website or player, you have to setup a <em>crossdomain.xml</em> file.</p>

<h3>SMIL contents</h3>

Here is a basic example, using three different streams:</p>

<pre>
&lt;smil&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta base="rtmp://example.com/vod/" /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;switch&gt;
      &lt;video src="myVideo-high.mp4" height="720" system-bitrate="2000000" width="1280" /&gt;
      &lt;video src="myVideo-medium.mp4" height="360" system-bitrate="800000" width="640" /&gt;
      &lt;video src="myVideo-low.mp4" height="180" system-bitrate="300000" width="320" /&gt;
    &lt;/switch&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/smil&gt;
</pre>

<p>The switching of quality is automatically done by JW Player, who selects the highest quality:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Whose <em>system-bitrate</em> fits the current bandwidth of the connection.</li>
    <li>Whose <em>width</em> fits the current width of the player screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Users are able to override the automated selection by setting the quality from a popup menu. The <em>height</em> attributes of the streams in the manifest are used to set the labels of this menu (e.g. <em>720p</em>).</p>

<h3>Wowza 3</h3>

<p>Wowza Media Server 3 introduced dedicated support for these SMIL manifests. If you are running version 3.1.2.15 or higher, append <strong>/jwplayer.smil</strong> to the URL of your adaptive streams to get these manifests.</p>

<p>Here is how the URL to a SMIL manifest and an M3U8 manifest (for <a href="hls.html">Apple HLS streaming</a>) look like with Wowza3:</p>

<pre>
http://example.com/vod/smil:myvideo.smil/jwplayer.smil
http://example.com/vod/smil:myvideo.smil/manifest.m3u8
</pre>



<h2>Configuration Options</h2>

<p>RTMP supports a few configuration options to tweak playback of the streams. They are set in a dedicated <em>rtmp</em> options block.</p>

<h3><a name="bufferlength"></a>Buffer Length</h3>

<p>By default, JW Player tries to maintain a buffer length of <em>3 seconds</em> for RTMP video. This means that 3 seconds of video is fetched from the server and ready to play at all times. This can be changed to another value using the RTMP <strong>bufferlength</strong> option:</p>

<pre>
jwplayer("myElement").setup({
    file: "rtmp://example.com/vod/mp4:myVideo.mp4",
    height: 360,
    image: "/assets/myVideo.jpg",
    rtmp: {
        bufferlength: 0.1
    },
    width: 640
});
</pre>

<p>Sane values range from <em>0.1</em> (for low latency live streams) to <em>10</em> (to prevent frequent re-buffering).</p>

<h3><a name="fcsubscribe"></a>FC Subscribe</h3>

<p>When streaming RTMP live streams using the Akamai, Edgecast or Limelight CDN, players cannot simply connect to the live stream. Instead, they have to subscribe to it, by sending a so-called <strong>FC Subscribe</strong> call to the server. JW Player includes support for this, using the RTMP <strong>subscribe</strong> option:</p>

<pre>
jwplayer("myElement").setup({
    file: "rtmp://example.com/xxxx/myStream",
    height: 360,
    image: "/assets/myLivestream.jpg",
    rtmp: {
        subscribe: true
    },
    width: 640
});
</pre>

<p>Note this functionality only works for single RTMP streams. For multi-bitrate live streaming, the HLS protocol should be used.</p>

<h3><a name="securetoken"></a>Secure Token</h3>

<p>The Wowza Media Server includes a feature called <a href="http://www.wowza.com/forums/content.php?115">Secure Token</a> that is used to protect your streams from downloading. It works by having the player send a token to the server, which is verified before the stream is started. JW Player supports this mechanism, using the RTMP <strong>securetoken</strong> option:</p>

<pre>
jwplayer("myElement").setup({
    file: "rtmp://example.com/vod/mp4:myVideo.mp4",
    height: 360,
    image: "/assets/myVideo.jpg",
    rtmp: {
        securetoken: "Kosif093n203a"
    },
    width: 640
});
</pre>

<p>Since the token is part of your HTML, downloaders could extract it to grab your streams. Incremental security is achieved by compiling this token into the player. See our <a href="http://developer.longtailvideo.com">developer site</a> for more information (note: very techie!).</p>
