<h1>Quick Start</h1>

<p>Getting JW Player up and running is now easier than ever. Only a few lines of HTML code is needed to embed a video that works on any desktop browser and mobile device. This guide walks through the necessary steps.</p>



<h2>Uploading the Files</h2>

<p>In order to embed a video, you first need the file uploaded to your server. Ensure it is in the MP4 format, since that can be played on any browser and device (including iPad, iPhone and Android).</p>

<ul>
<li>If your video is not in the MP4 format, you can convert it using a free tool like Handbrake. See our <a href="">Video Encoding guide</a> for more info.</li>
<li>If you have no video at hand, feel free to use <a href="http://content.bitsontherun.com/videos/bkaovAYt-52qL9xLP.mp4">this short clip</a> for your testing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Second, you should grab JW Player <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/players/jw-flv-player/">from our site</a> and upload it to your webserver. The following three files need uploaded and placed in a directory that's accessible from the internet:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>jwplayer.js</strong>: the overall embed library.</li>
<li><strong>jwplayer.html5.js</strong>: the actual HTML5 player.</li>
<li><strong>jwplayer.flash.js</strong>: the actual Flash player.</li>
</ol>

<p>Third, you should upload a poster image to your server. This image (in JPG format) is displayed before the video starts. An interesting frame from the video usually works well to draw attention and entices users to click <em>play</em>. <a href="http://content.bitsontherun.com/thumbs/bkaovAYt-480.jpg">Here is an image</a> for our short test clip.</p>



<h2>Embedding the Player</h2>

<p>With all files uploaded to your site, embedding the JW Player is a simple, 3-step process. Open your web page in an HTML editor and:</p>

<ol>
<li>Load the JW Player embed library from the head of your page:
<pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/jwplayer.js" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
</li>
<li>Insert a &lt;div&gt; element with a unique <em>id</em> at the location you want the player to appear:
<pre>&lt;div id="myElement"&gt;Loading the player ...&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
</li>
<li>Insert a script that invokes the JW Player <em>setup()</em> call on your &lt;div&gt;:</li>
<pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    jwplayer("myElement").setup({
        file: "/uploads/example.mp4",
        height: 270,
        image: "/uploads/example.jpg",
        width: 480
    });
&lt;/script&gt;</pre></li>
</ol>

<p>In the setup() block, <em>file</em> and <em>image</em> should be the URLs to your video file and poster images. Their paths should be relative to the HTML page (just like when embedding an image using &lt;img&gt;). The <em>height</em> and <em>width</em> are used to set the dimensions of the player. Feel free to change these to values that make the player nicely fit your page.</p>



<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>That's it! With a few lines of code, you embedded a video that can be watched on any desktop browser, tablet or mobile phone. Next, JW Player supports many options for enhancing and tuning your audio or video embeds. Here are a few interesting guides:</p>
