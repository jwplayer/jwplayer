<h1>JavaScript API Reference</h1>

<p>This guide provides a reference of all JavaScript API calls available in JW Player. For an introduction to and general overview of the player API, see <a href="scripting.html">Using the JavaScript API</a>.</p>




<h2><a name="ready"></a>Ready</h2>

<p>These API calls are used to learn when and with which technology players are instantiated.</p>

<dl><dt>getRenderingMode()</dt><dd>
Returns the rendering mode in which the player is setup. Can be <strong>flash</strong> or <strong>html5</strong>.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>onReady(<em>callback</em>)</dt><dd>
Fired when the player has initialized and is ready for playback. Has no attributes.
</dd></dl>


<h2><a name="playlist"></a>Playlist</h2>

<p>These API calls are used for loading and retrieving the current playlist (of one or more items), as well as for navigating between playlist items.</p>


<dl><dt>getPlaylist()</dt><dd>
Returns the player's current playlist array.
</dd><dt>getPlaylistItem(<em>index</em>)</dt><dd>
Returns the playlist item object at the specified index. If the index is not specified, the currently playing playlistItem is returned.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>load(<em>playlist</em>)</dt><dd>
Loads a new playlist into the player. The <em>playlist</em> parameter is required and can be either an <em>array</em> with playlist items or a <em>string</em> that points to the location of an RSS feed.
</dd><dt>playlistItem(<em>index</em>)</dt><dd>
Start playback of the playlist item at the specified index.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>onPlaylist(<em>callback</em>)</dt><dd>
Fired when a new playlist has been loaded into the player. Note this event is not fired as part of the initial playlist load (playlist is loaded when <strong>onReady</strong> is called). Event attributes:
<ul><li><strong>playlist</strong> (Array): The new playlist; an array of playlist items.
</li></ul></dd><dt>onPlaylistItem(<em>callback</em>)</dt><dd>
Fired when the playlist index changes to a new playlist item. This event occurs before the player begins playing the new playlist item. Event attributes:
<ul><li><strong>index</strong> (Number): Zero-based index into the playlist array (e.g. 0 is the first item).
</li><li><strong>playlist</strong> (Array): The new playlist; an array of playlist items.
</li></ul></dd><dt>onComplete(<em>callback</em>)</dt><dd>
Fired every time when a playlist item completes playback. It has no event attributes.
</dd><dt>onPlaylistComplete(<em>callback</em>)</dt><dd>
Fired when the player is done playing all items in the playlist. However, if the <strong>repeat</strong> option is set <em>true</em>, this is never fired.</dd></dl>


<h2><a name="buffer"></a>Buffer</h2>

<p>These API calls are used to update clients with the percentage of a file that's buffered into the player. This only applies to progressive downloads of media; streaming media do not expose this behavior.</p>

<dl><dt>getBuffer()</dt><dd>
Returns the current PlaylistItem's filled buffer, as a percentage (0 to 100) of the total video's length.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>onBufferChange(<em>callback</em>)</dt><dd>
Fired when the currently playing item loads additional data into its buffer. Event attributes:
<ul><li><strong>buffer</strong> (Number): Percentage between 0 and 100 of the current media that is buffered.
</li></ul></dd></dl>


<h2><a name="playback"></a>Playback</h2>

<p>These API calls are used to retrieve and change the current playback state of the player: is the player idle, buffering, playing or paused.</p>

<dl><dt>getState()</dt><dd>
Returns the player's current playback state. These can be:
<ul><li><strong>IDLE</strong>: either playback has not started or playback was stopped (due to a stop() call or an error). Either the <em>play</em> or the <em>error</em> icon is visible in the display.
</li><li><strong>BUFFERING</strong>: user pressed play, but sufficient data to start playback has to be loaded first. The <em>buffering</em> icon is visible in the display.
</li><li><strong>PLAYING</strong>: the video is currently playing. No icon is visible in the display.
</li><li><strong>PAUSED</strong>: the video is currently paused. The <em>play</em> icon is visible in the display.
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>play(<em>state</em>)</dt><dd>
Toggles playback of the player. If the state is set <strong>true</strong> the player will start playing, if set <strong>false</strong> the player will pause and if omitted, the player will toggle playback.
</dd><dt>pause(<em>state</em>)</dt><dd>
Toggles playback of the player. If the state is set <strong>true</strong> the player will pause, if set <strong>false</strong> the player will start playing and if omitted, the player will toggle playback.
</dd><dt>stop()</dt><dd>
Stops the player (returning it to the IDLE state) and unloads the currently playing media file.
</dd></dl>


<dl><dt>onBeforePlay(<em>callback</em>)</dt><dd>
Fired just before the player begins playing. Unlike the onPlay event, the player will not have begun playing or buffering when triggered. This event can be used to prevent playback by calling <strong>stop()</strong>.
</dd><dt>onPlay(<em>callback</em>)</dt><dd>
Fired when the player enters the PLAYING state. Event attributes:
<ul><li><strong>oldstate</strong> (String): the state the player moved from. Can be BUFFERING or PAUSED.
</li></ul></dd><dt>onPause(<em>callback</em>)</dt><dd>
Fired when the player enters the PAUSED state. Event attributes:
<ul><li><strong>oldstate</strong> (String): the state the player moved from. Can be BUFFERING or PLAYING.
</li></ul></dd><dt>onBuffer(<em>callback</em>)</dt><dd>
Fired when the player enters the BUFFERING state. Event attributes:
<ul><li><strong>oldstate</strong> (String): the state the player moved from. Can be IDLE, PLAYING or PAUSED.
</li></ul></dd><dt>onIdle(<em>callback</em>)</dt><dd>
Fired when the player enters the IDLE state. Event attributes:
<ul><li><strong>oldstate</strong> (String): the state the player moved from. Can be BUFFERING, PLAYING or PAUSED.
</li></ul></dd></dl>



<h2><a name="seek"></a>Seek</h2>

<p>These API calls are used to retrieve and update the current media playback position.</p>

<dl><dt>getPosition()</dt><dd>
Returns the current playback position in seconds, as a number.
</dd><dt>getDuration()</dt><dd>
Returns the currently playing PlaylistItem's duration in seconds, as a number. If a duration of <strong>-1</strong> is returned, the current media is a live stream and therefore has no position, duration or seek capability.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>seek(<em>position</em>)</dt><dd>
Jump to the specified position within the currently playing item. The <strong>position</strong> is required and must be provided as an integer, in seconds.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>onSeek(<em>callback</em>)</dt><dd>
Fired after a seek has been requested either by scrubbing the controlbar or through the API. Event attributes:
<ul><li><strong>position</strong> (Number): The position of the player before the player seeks (in seconds).
</li><li><strong>offset</strong> (Number): The requested position to seek to (in seconds).
</li></ul></dd><dt>onTime(<em>callback</em>)</dt><dd>
While the player is playing, this event is fired as the playback position gets updated. This may occur as frequently as 10 times per second. Event attributes:
<ul><li><strong>duration</strong> (Number): Duration of the current item in seconds.
</li><li><strong>position</strong> (Number): Playback position in seconds.
</li></ul></dd></dl>
<p>
Note that seeking for progressive downloads in Flash only works within the already downloaded portion. When seeking beyond that section, the video seeks to the last downloaded frame. This issue can be circumvented by implementing <a href="pseudo.html">Pseudo Streaming in Flash</a>. This issue is not present for HTML5.
</p>



<h2><a name="volume"></a>Volume</h2>

<p>These API calls are used to change the playback volume of the player. Note they only work on desktop browsers, <strong>not</strong> on mobile devices.</p>

<dl><dt>getMute()</dt><dd>
Returns the player's current audio muting state (<strong>true</strong> when there's no sound).
</dd><dt>getVolume()</dt><dd>
Returns the current playback volume percentage, as a number from 0 to 100.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>setMute(<em>state</em>)</dt><dd>
Change the player's mute state (no sound). If the state is undefined, perform a muting toggle. Otherwise, mute the player if <strong>true</strong>, and unmute if <strong>false</strong>.
</dd><dt>setVolume(<em>volume</em>)</dt><dd>
Sets the player's audio volume percentage, as a number between 0 and 100.
</dd></dl>

<ul><li><strong>volume</strong> (Number): New volume percentage.
</li></ul></dd></dl>



<h2><a name="resize"></a>Resize</h2>

<p>These API calls are used to retrieve and update the current player dimensions and fullscreen state. Note there is no API call to <strong>set fullscreen</strong>, due to phishing-related security restrictions in both Flash and HTML5.</p>

<dl><dt>getFullscreen</dt><dd>
Returns the current fullscreen state (<strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>).
</dd><dt>getHeight</dt><dd>
Returns the player's current height, in pixels.
</dd><dt>getWidth</dt><dd>
Returns the player's current width, in pixels.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>resize(<em>width</em>, <em>height</em>)</dt><dd>
Resizes the player to the specified width and height, in pixels. It's also possible to set percentages (e.g. <strong>50%</strong>).

<p>These API calls are used to listen to or update the video quality if multiple quality levels of a video are provided.</p>

<dl><dt>getQualityLevels()</dt><dd>
Returns an array with quality levels from the player. Each level is an object that always contains a <strong>label</strong> property and sometimes additional properties (like <strong>width</strong> or <strong>bitrate</strong>).
</dd><dt>getCurrentQuality()</dt><dd>
Returns the index of the currently active quality level.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>setCurrentQuality(<em>index</em>)</dt><dd>
Change the quality level to the provided index. The index must be within the list provided by <strong>getQualityLevels</strong>.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>onQualityLevels(<em>callback</em>)</dt><dd>

</li></ul></dd><dt>onQualityChange (<em>callback</em>)</dt><dd>
Fired when the active quality level is changed. Happens in respons to e.g. a user clicking the controlbar quality menu or a script calling <em>setCurrentQuality</em>. Event attributes:
<ul><li><strong>currentQuality</strong> (Number): index of the new quality level in the <em>getQualityLevels()</em>  array.
</li></ul></dd></dl>



<h2><a name="button"></a>Button</h2>

<p>With the button API, it's possible to add buttons to the dock, e.g. for social sharing, video discovery, interface toggles or registrations/logins.</p>

<dl><dt>addButton(<em>icon, label, handler, id</em>)</dt><dd>
Adds a button to the dock. Attributes:
<ul><li><strong>icon</strong> (String): The URL to a GIF, JPG or PNG image that is displayed in the button. Monochromatic, white icons of about 20x20 pixels work well with many skins. Base64 encoded image strings do not work.
</li><li><strong>label</strong> (String): Human-readable label of the button (e.g. <em>Buy this Video</em>), visible in a tooltip on rollover.
</li><li><strong>handler</strong> (Function): The JavaScript function that is called when the button is clicked.

</li></ul></dd><dt>removeButton(<em>id</em>)</dt><dd>
Removes a button from the dock. Attributes:
<ul><li><strong>id</strong> (String): The id used to identify the button when it was added.
</li></ul></dd></dl>



<h2><a name="controls"></a>Controls</h2>

<p>This API call allows developers to interact with the built-in player controls (dock buttons, controlbar and display icons). Note that enabled controls will still fade out during playback if the video has no keyboard/mouse focus. When controls are disabled, JW Player is completely chrome-less.</p>

<dl><dt>getControls()</dt><dd>
Returns whether the built-in controls are currently enabled.
</dd><dt>getSafeRegion()</dt><dd>
Returns an array with the region of the display not used by the controls. Scripts and plugins use this information to ensure their visual assets don't overlap with the controls. An example region the call can return is: <pre>{ x:0, y:30, width:480, height:200 }</pre>
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>setControls(<em>controls</em>)</dt><dd>
Enable the built-in controls by setting them <strong>true</strong>, disable the controls by setting them <strong>false</strong>.
</dd></dl>

<dl><dt>onControls(<em>callback</em>)</dt><dd>
Fired when controls are enabled or disabled by a script. Event attributes:
<ul><li><strong>controls</strong> (Boolean): New state of the controls. Is <strong>true</strong> when the controls were just enabled.
</li></ul></dd><dt>onDisplayClick(<em>callback</em>)</dt><dd>
Fired when a user clicks the video display. Especially useful for wiring your own controls when the built-in ones are disabled. Note the default click action (toggling play/pause) will still occur. There are no event attributes.
</li></ul></dd></dl>



<h2><a name="error"></a>Error</h2>

<p>This API call allows developers to listen for and react to <em>media loading errors</em> (e.g. when a video URL is not found or a streaming server disconnects).</p>

<dl><dt>onError(<em>callback</em>)</dt><dd>
Fired when a media loading error has occurred in the player. Event attributes:
<ul><li><strong>message</strong> (String): The reason for the error. See <a href="troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting your Setup</a> for a list of all possible media loading errors.
</li></ul></dd></dl>

<p>Note an error event is <strong>not</strong> fired when a <em>player setup error</em> occurs, since this generally happens before the API is ready.



<h2><a name="metadata"></a>Metadata</h2>

<p>This API call allows developers to listen for metadata embedded in the media file (e.g. dimensions or TX3G cues in MP4 files).</p>

<dl><dt>onMeta(<em>callback</em>)</dt><dd>
Fired when new metadata has been broadcasted by the player. Event attributes:
<ul><li><em>metadata</em> (Object): Object containing the new metadata. This can be metadata hidden in the media (XMP, ID3, keyframes) or metadata broadcasted by the playback provider (bandwidth, quality switches).
</li></ul></dd></dl>
